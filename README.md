Summary: Given a version number Ex: 2.1.0 = MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

    - MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
    - MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
    - PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
